- At certain resolutions, the transition between 0, 5, 10, and 15 gratitude crystals causes an exaggerated change to the placement calculation
- At certain resolutions, parts of Sky Keep are cut off within the dungeon tracker

# 1.3.0

## Added

- Goddess Cube Tracking
  - Goddess Cubes are now tracked separately in their own panel
  - Goddess cubes display like all other locations in the tracker (green when
    in logic, red when out) and can be marked like normal locations
  - Marking a cube puts the chest it opens fully into logic (assuming you can
    reach the chest)
  - Chests which can be reached, and their cube can also be reached, but
    the cube has not been marked are considered to be semi-in-logic (more
    on that later)
- Options
  - When launching the tracker, you will now be presented with a page where
    you can select the correct options
  - Options will filter out locations where progress items cannot appear
    automatically
  - Options also integrate correctly with logic for locations where options
    have an impact (I.e. Thunderhead)
  - Items that you start with are automatically tracked when appropriate for
    the given options - Swordless off starts with Goddess Sword - 3 starting tablets starts with all 3 tablets (all others must be entered
    manually because they are selected randomly)
- Added a color picker to change the background color of the tracker (we
  recommend aqua for chroma keying)
- New logic states
  - Rendering of locations and determination of in/out of logic state has been
    updated to allow for more than two states
  - Currently, there are three used states: in-logic (green), semi-logic (orange), out-logic (red). - In logic means the location can be reached with no additional work - Semi-logic means that the location can be reached, but something
    required to get there is missing. This only applies to items where
    the location is restricted. Currently this state only exists for
    Goddess Chests, but will eventually be expanded upon (and likely
    sub divided further) - Out-logic means that the location cannot be reached without the
    use of glitches given the currently tracked items
  - This change gives us incredible flexibility in creating dynamic and useful
    additional display information within the tracker
  - Only locations that are fully in logic are considered for counters

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug that caused the slingshot to render in the wrong place when
  unmarked
- Fixed the positioning of the following items:
  - Practice Sword
  - Goddess Sword
  - Goddess Longsword
  - Goddess Whitesword
  - Slingshot
- Fixed a bug that caused logic tooltips to contain duplicate entries
- Fixed a bug that caused logic tooltips to contain empty entries
- Fixed Sky Keep in the Dungeon Tracker getting cut off at certain resolutions
- Fixed a bug that could cause the Item Tracker to shift left, possibly partially
  offscreen
- Fixed a bug that caused locations to be improperly considered out of logic
  during the initialization of the location list

## Changes

- Shifted the entire Item Tracker to the right slightly. How far depends on resolution
- Adjusted the padding on the Location tracker. Fewer (if any) locations should
  overflow horizontally
- When appropriate, logic will have minor simplifications applied to it
- Gratitude crystal logical requirements are now greatly simplified

## Known Bugs

- Certain resize actions (specifically using the maximize button) do not cause the layout to update correctly for some components. Clicking any other item will fix
  all misaligned items
- At certain resolutions, sidequest items do not appear in the correct locations
- At certain resolutions, the transition between 0, 5, 10, and 15 gratitude crystals causes an exaggerated change to the placement calculation
- At certain resolutions, some item placements are slightly off

## Additions

- Added support for tracking path hints (by YourAverageLink)
  - Right clicking a region has a new submenu for path hints, which will then display an icon of the corresponding boss near the region
- Added support for the new options (by YourAverageLink)
  - Any starting items that appear in the supplied settings string will be given to start with.
  - Any locations excluded in the settings string will not appear on the tracker.
- Added progressive item support (by YourAverageLink)
- Added triforce support (by YourAverageLink)
  - Stone of trials is now part of Sky Keep
- Added semi-logical support for Batreaux's checks (by YourAverageLink)
  - Checks will be semi-logical if you have access to enough loose crystals to get the reward
- Added map layout (by YourAverageLink)
  - If the map layout is enabled, the entire tracker is rearranged to make room for a large map display.
    - Most notably, the dungeon block is completely redesigned, containing just the keys and dungeon abbreviations, and it has been moved with the rest of the items.
  - A world map is shown, containing markers for the Thunderhead and Sky regions, as well as markers for four submaps (Skyloft, Faron, Eldin, and Lanayru)
    - Hovering over a map marker displays the region name, how many checks are accessible, and how many are remaining. If a hint has been assigned to a region, it is also shown in the tooltip. Hovering over a submap displays the sum of all accessible and remaining checks in the province, as well as any hints marked in the submap's regions.
    - The marker itself has the 'checked' color if no locations remain, the 'outLogic' color if no locations are accessible, the 'semiLogic' color with a number displaying how many checks are accessible if some are, and the 'inLogic' color plus how many locations are accessible if every location remainijg in the region is accessible. Markers have a 'squircle' shape (a square with rounded corners)
    - Submaps
      - When a submap marker is clicked, the map changes to the map for the selected submap. Its own regions are added, along with a button to return to the world map.
    - Special markers
      - Silent realms have circular markers on the map.
      - Dungeon entrances have square markers on the map. If dungeon entrance rando is off, they are bound to their vanilla dungeon by default.
        - If the entrance has no assigned dungeon, it displays '?', and when clicked, opens a context menu to select a dungeon to bind.
        - Once a dungeon is bound, it is treated as a region in the containing submap (counts towards check total). It can be clicked on to open the check list, and it can be right-clicked to assign hints or to change which dungeon is bound there.
